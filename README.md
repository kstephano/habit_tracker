## Description
Habits are Forever is a website that allows users to track their habits, be it custom or default. Users can enter an amount for a habit in order to increase its progress. Gamification elements such as streaks, top streaks and a leaderboard are
implemented to encourage user engagement. Authentication using JsonWebToken and BCrypt as well as refresh tokens are used to ensure account security. 

This website is deployed on [Netlify](https://habitsareforever.netlify.app/index.html) and has a Node Express server deployed through [Heroku](warm-forest-14168.herokuapp.com/).
